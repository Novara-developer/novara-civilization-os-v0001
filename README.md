# Novara Civilization OS Kernel (v0.0001)

This repo is the **kernel** of my Civilization OS experiment.

- Goal: make AI decisions verifiable and tamper-evident.
- Core: an immutable audit log (`audit_events`) with hash chain.
- Status: design-first, implemented later in Flask/SQLite.

This is not just an app.
It is the v0.0001 blueprint of an **evidence-based civilization OS**.
