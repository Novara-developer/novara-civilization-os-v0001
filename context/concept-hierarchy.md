# Novara / Civilization OS – Concept Hierarchy (v0.0001)

_Last updated: 2025-11-24 (UTC)_

This document describes the **conceptual layers** of Novara / Civilization OS.
It answers: “What are the main ideas, and how do they relate?”

---

## Layer 0 – Personal OS

- Daily life logs
- Tasks / notes / time tracking
- Decisions about:
  - Study
  - Money
  - Health
- Goal:
  - Prove that **one human** can be fully auditable (by themselves + a trusted observer)

---

## Layer 1 – Evidence OS

- `audit_events` table
- Hash chain (prev_hash → hash)
- `self_contracts` (rules that bind the operator)
- Goal:
  - Make it **embarrassing** to operate AI without verifiable logs

---

## Layer 2 – Institution OS

- Schools / companies / small governments
- Use Novara for:
  - Credentials
  - SLO + refunds
  - Risk decisions
- Goal:
  - Replace “trust me, bro” with **“show me the bundle”**

---

## Layer 3 – Civilization OS

- Multi-TEE attestations
- Independence Index
- Public dashboards
- Regulatory adoption
- Goal:
  - Make “proof” the default interface between:
    - Citizens
    - Companies
    - States
    - AIs

---

## Relationship

- You cannot **skip** layers:
  - If Layer 0 fails, Layer 1 is fake.
  - If Layer 1 is weak, Layer 2 is theatre.
  - If Layer 2 is corrupt, Layer 3 is propaganda.

Novara v0.0001 focuses on:

- Layer 0 (Personal OS)
- Layer 1 (Evidence OS)

Everything else is **future work**.
